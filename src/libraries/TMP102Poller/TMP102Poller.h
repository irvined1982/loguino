/** The TMP102 is a two-wire, serial output temperature sensor available 
 * in a tiny SOT563 package. Requiring no external components, the TMP102 
 * is capable of reading temperatures to a resolution of 0.0625Â°C.
 *
 * This class provides a poller for the TMP102 sensor, using the i2c bus,
 * supporting both standalone sensors and the sparkfun breakout.
 * See: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9418
 *
 * Datasheet: http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/tmp102.pdf
 *
 * \bug Conversion factor isn't correct, so temperature is currently off, although
 * reporting a linear reading still.
