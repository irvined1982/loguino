The TMP102 is a digital temperature sensor from Texas Instruments with an I2C
interface.

The temperature sensor in the TMP102 is the chip itself. Thermal paths run
through the package leads, as well as the plastic package. The lower thermal
resistance of metal causes the leads to provide the primary thermal path.

To maintain accuracy in applications requiring air or surface temperature
measurement, care should be taken to isolate the package and leads from
ambient air temperature. A thermally-conductive adhesive is helpful in
achieving accurate surface temperature measurement.
