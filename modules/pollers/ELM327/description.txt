The ELM327 is a programmed microcontroller produced by ELM Electronics for
translating the on-board diagnostics (OBD) interface found in most modern cars.
The ELM327 command protocol is one of the most popular PC-to-OBD interface
standards and is also implemented by other vendors.

Loguino can communicate with the ELM327 via a serial interface, and logs the
standard OBDII metrics.
