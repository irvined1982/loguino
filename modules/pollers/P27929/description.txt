The MG811 CO2 Sensor offers excellent performance for use in a wide range of
applications, including air quality monitoring, smoke alarms, mine and tunnel
warning systems, greenhouses, etc. The sensor is easy to use and can be easily
incorporated in a small portable unit, or so goes the documentation.  Parallax
offer a gas sensor board, (Part number 27929) which has a built in Op-Amp, and
optional alarm.

By connecting TP1 to an analog input on the arduino, it is possible to measure
CO2 in parts per million. (PPM) The calculation from voltage to PPM is done
based on code posted on the parallax forum, and uses the suggested values for
estimating the slope from the datasheet.
