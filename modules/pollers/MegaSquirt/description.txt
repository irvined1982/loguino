A MegaSquirt is a complete standalone fuel injection controller with software
and hardware, developed by Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo. The software for the
platform is open for modification and provides for fuel, ignition and idle air
control in most cases, keeping the cost low. Whilst lacking in features
compared to some controllers, for the cost it provides an excellent solution.
Loguino can poll MegaSquirt ECUâ€™s over the Serial line at about 5-10Hz,
providing in depth metrics on the Engine Management System.

This poller reads the data table from the Megasquirt over the Serial interface
and extracts the data into metrics.  The amount of data retrieved from the
Megasquirt is not insignificant, it is possible to configure which metrics
are logged in order to save space or improve logging performance.
