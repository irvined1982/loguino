Usually, connection to a GPS device is straightforward, you can either use a
shield, such as the one from Adafruit, which makes life very easy, or connect
the GPS right up to the Arduino board itself.

Make sure that your GPS outputs data at TTL levels, else you will need to make
a TTL to Serial Adaptor using something like the MAX232 chip.
