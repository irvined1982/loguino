The Gas Sensor Board, fitted with a CO Gas Sensor,  allows for the electronic
detection of carbon monoxide concentration present in the air. The board
provides a simple LOW/HIGH alarm output, where HIGH indicates that the preset
CO gas level has been reached or exceeded.  However, by connecting TP1 to an
analog pin, it is also possible to obtain a CO reading.  At this stage I do not
have calibration information.
