Loguino can function as a network server listening on a TCP port using the
Loguino Ethernet, or the Ethernet shield.  The network logger supports the
following modes of operation:

Network Server

When server mode is enabled, the logger listens for incoming connections on a
configurable (Default is 23/Telnet) TCP port. Up to four clients can connect,
each client receives the log messages each time they are sent from a poller.
In this mode all data is sent in clear text and no authentication is possible.

MQTT Client

When the MQTT client is enabled, Loguino will publish to a preconfigured MQTT
broker. The topic of each message is set to the Loguino logger name, and the
value is logged as the data.
